## üöÄ Responsibilities

While working part-time as a full-stack developer at Aftercode, I was primarily responsible for building their agency website frontend. My work included:

- Building a responsive UI using **Next.js App Router** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Implementing smooth page transitions with **Framer Motion**
- Handling API calls and caching with **TanStack Query**
- Integrating **internationalization** (EN/FR) using `next-i18n`, synchronized with Strapi‚Äôs native i18n
- Implementing and validating the **booking form** using React Hook Form
- Ensuring performance and accessibility for production

I also contributed minor tweaks on the Strapi backend, but my main focus was the frontend experience.

## üß© Architecture & Data Flow

- **Strapi** serves as the CMS and API layer, managing team members, project entries, and multilingual content.
- **TanStack Query** handles REST data fetching, caching, and state management on the frontend.
- **next-i18n** syncs with Strapi's localized content to serve the correct language version to users.
- Pages are rendered server-side via **Next.js**, with dynamic content populated on load.

## üß≠ Timeline & Context

This project was built during my part-time role at Aftercode as a full-stack developer. I was brought on to help the agency develop and launch their own marketing site ‚Äî showcasing their services, portfolio, and team, with a modern and performant frontend stack.

It was an opportunity to implement modern frontend architecture and collaborate directly with their internal team on UI/UX decisions and API usage.
