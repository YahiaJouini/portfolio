    <p>I'm a pragmatic developer who builds systems that make senseâ€”functional, scalable, and focused on real users. I care about architecture as much as implementation, and I approach problems by breaking them down, questioning assumptions, and aiming for long-term clarity.</p>
    <p>I work well in fast-moving environments where ownership matters. Whether contributing in a team or handling things independently, I stay focused on what needs to be done and why. Clean logic, thoughtful decisions, and steady iteration are how I work.</p>
    <p>I don't limit myself to one role or label. I adapt quickly, learn on the fly, and stay outcome-drivenâ€”from early planning to final delivery.</p>`,
